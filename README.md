# DensityX.py
Python script that takes an excel spreadsheet containing major oxide data, T, and P for a silicate melt and outputs the density of each sample as a new excel spreadsheet.

DensityX is also distributed as a python library, so you can use this model in your own python code. Install using pip install densityx. See contents of the /lib folder for a README with example usage of the library. The module densityx takes a pandas dataframe and returns a pandas dataframe.
